# Assembly
Hello, This is the Assembly code page! üëã

All the Codes here were written when I studied Microcontroller Engineering I for the first year at the University of Manchester. 

We have used processor 'PIC18F8722', and all the examples are from the provided handbook. ‚ö°Ô∏è

Codes for Practical Exams are the solution I wrote for the four corresponding mock exams.

Examples are not all of them provided, but most of the important exercises. 

For the mock exams, there are three levels: Basic (50%), Medium (75%), and Advanced(100%), and the numbers indicate the maximum grade that can be marked.

I only attempted the "Advanced" level except Practical Exam 3. Thank you!
