# Assembly
Hello, This is Assembly code page!

All the Codes here are written when I was studying Microcontroller Engineering I for the first year at the University of Manchester.

We have used processor 'PIC18F8722' and all the examples are from the provided handbook and Practical Exams are the solution for the 4 corresponding each mock exams.

Examples are not the all of them provided, but most of significant exercises. 

For the mock exams, there are three levels: Basic (50%), Medium (75%), and Advanced(100%) and the numbers indicate the maximum grade can be marked.

I only attempted "Advanced" level and uploaded. Thank you.
